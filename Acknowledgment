I would like to express my gratitude for everyone who has helped me in the implementation and research analysis 
of the project. I consider myself extremely fortunate for the consistent guidance and support I have had 
as a part of the DCS at the University of Toronto with the never ending support from family and friends.
Regardless of how bleak things appeared at times, they have all helped me work towards the project with tenacity
and focus.
I would like to begin by conveying sincere gratitude to my advisor Nick Koudas for his guidance, undying support and 
patiently answering all my doubts. His unique approach towards research and the deep insight into various topics 
have been the greatest inspiration and support I have had throughout.
Graduate course on Mobile computing taught by Prof. Eyal De Lara was extremely helping in the cloud computing propsal.
I also would like to convey special thanks to Martin Grund from Hasso Plattner Institute for his constant guidance
 and helping me work on the research prototype 'Hyrise'.
And last but not the least, I want to mention the great help from the Research teams at the IBM Laboratories and
Microsoft for giving me access to their latest research publications and answering the related queries.

hybrid-storage
==============
Hybrid in-memory storage engines have evolved as the solution for real-time analytics and forecasting scenarios, due to the performance and storage capabilities over the disk-based counterparts. With the recent advent of multi-core architectures and DRAMs becoming relatively inexpensive, the complete working set needed for transactional and analytical processing of small-to-big enterprise applications can be kept in memory. The candidate based layout selection algorithm presently being used in HYRISE supports dynamic vertical partitioning of relational tables into containers with disjoint set of attributes, which includes hot data (frequently used working-set) and cold data (non-frequently used). While the hot data of an enterprise application can be considered as constant with respect to the data volume, the total amount gradually increases. Therefore, the cold data lessens the main-memory utilization, incurring an increased cost and complexity and affecting the query performance. 
This situation can be resolved by moving the cold data to a fairly less expensive and easily accessible storage medium like a cloud.  The efficacy of data access by using vertical partitions against the proposed hybrid cloud storage is investigated, ensuring that the workload performance is not degraded.

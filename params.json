With the recent advent of multi-core architectures and DRAMs becoming relatively inexpensive, the complete working set needed for transactional and analytical processing of small-to-big enterprise applications can be kept in memory. The candidate based layout selection algorithm presently being used in HYRISE supports dynamic vertical partitioning of relational tables into containers with disjoint set of attributes, which includes hot data (frequently used working-set) and cold data (non-frequently used). An evaluation of the performance of Layout selection algorithm is presented. The cold data lessens the main-memory utilization, incurring an increased cost and complexity and affecting the query performance. The classification and access and moving of the cold data to a fairly less expensive and easily accessible secondary storage medium is further analyzed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<a name=\"goal\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#goal\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Goal</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hyrise storage engine is evaluated for optimality in the layout selected as a result of vertical partitioning, considering the increasing data volumes and vague data access patterns of enterprise applications. Cloud-integrated in-memory storage is proposed and analyzed to improve the overall performance by performing workload-aware data tiering. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<a name=\"author-and-contributor\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#author-and-contributor\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Author and Contributor</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Vandana Saini (<a href=\"https://github.com/vandsaini\" class=\"user-mention\">@vandsaini</a>) <a href=\"mailto:vsaini@cs.toronto.edu\">vsaini@cs.toronto.edu</a></p>\r\n     \r\n  </body>\r\n</html>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
